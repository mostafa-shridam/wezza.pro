    Cairo University 
also known as the Egyptian University from 1908 to 1940, 
and King Fuad I University and Fu'ād al-Awwal University from 1940 to 1952,
 is Egypt's premier public university. Its main campus is in Giza,
  immediately across the Nile from Cairo. It was founded on 21 December 1908;
  , after being housed in various parts of Cairo, its faculties,
   beginning with the Faculty of Arts, were established on its current main
    campus in Giza in October 1929. It is the second oldest institution of 
    higher education in Egypt after Al Azhar University, notwithstanding the 
    pre-existing higher professional schools that later became constituent 
    colleges of the university. It was founded and funded as 
    the Egyptian University by a committee of private citizens with royal 
    patronage in 1908 and became a state institution under King Fuad I in 1925.
     In 1940, four years following his death, 
     the university was renamed King Fuad I University in his honor. 
     It was renamed a second time after the Egyptian revolution of 1952.
     The university currently enrolls approximately 155,000 students in 20 faculties 
     and 3 institutions.
      It counts three Nobel Laureates among its graduates and is one of the 50 largest 
      institutions of higher 
      education in the world by enrollment.
